# Data Structures & Algorithms

## Description
This project consists of abstract data types, such as linked lists, trees, stacks and queues, created using object-oriented programming in Python, as well as associated operations for each of the data types.

## Included Files
- Binary Trees: OOP implementation, insertion, and traversal
- Binary Tree Arrays: Array implementatiion, insertion, traversal, search and locating leaf nodes
- Circular Queues: OOP implementation, enqueueing and dequeueing
- Linear Queues: OOP implementation, enqueueing and dequeueing
- Linked Lists: OOP implementation, adding, deleting, and finding index
- Ordered Linked Lists: OOP implementation, insertion and deletion
- Priority Queues (Heaps): OOP implementation, enqueueing and dequeueing
- Stacks: OOP implementation, pushing, popping and peeking
- Stack-Queues: Implementing a Stack using two Queues, pushing and popping
